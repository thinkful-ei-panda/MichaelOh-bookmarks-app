1. I can add bookmarks that contain: title, url link, description, and rating(1-5)
2. I can see all my bookmarks when I first open app which shows just the condensed view with title and rating
3. I can see the expanded view when the bookmark is clicked which incudes the description as well as "Visit Site" which links to the URL
4. I can remove bookmarks from my list
5. I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark
6. I can select a dropdown menu to filter my list by ratings at or above the selected rating
